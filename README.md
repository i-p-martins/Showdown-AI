# Pokemon Showdown AI

The objective of this project is to create an artificial intelligence that uses a mix of computer vision 
techniques and statistical analysis to play a complex strategy game at a decent level of proficiency. 
The artificial intelligence’s proficiency will be measured by how well it performs at the game, this 
includes winning games, or defeating as many opponents as possible before being defeated, it will 
also be measured on how well it performs in a Turing test.

This project will serve as a benchmark for how Artificial intelligence techniques have improved over 
the years, and it will attempt to test the limit of the capability of an artificial intelligence to play 
games. 

The main outcomes of this project were: An AI capable of playing a full game of Pokémon to a level 
of skill where it bested players with several years of experience and still presents an opportunity to 
improve even further at the game, a dataset holding information on hundreds of different Pokémon 
and their different possible move sets in a competitive scene, which could help newer players to 
learn the game as well as more experienced players as an aid during battle, and a data set storing 
the effectiveness of every type on every Pokémon that currently exists.
